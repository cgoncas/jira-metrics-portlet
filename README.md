# JIRA Metrics Portlet

## Motivation

More and more often, development teams managers need to monitor current status of their projects based on some metrics defined by themselves.

JIRA is a proprietary issue tracking product, developed by Atlassian, used for bug tracking, issue tracking and project management.

As JIRA provides many metrics by itself, we've decided to start a [Liferay](http://www.liferay.com) + [AlloyUI](http://www.alloyui.com) + [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) integration portlet that allows to display some customized metrics in an easy and portal-deployable way. For that, a Liferay portal Admin, can deploy this portlet in his/her portal, allowing its users to watch metrics and stats defined, in an user-friendly style, using AlloyUI built-in cappabilities.
